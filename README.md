# Phishing Link Detection Using ML and Crowdsourcing

This project implements a hybrid phishing detection system using **Logistic Regression** and a **crowdsourcing feedback loop**. It provides a web-based interface (built with Django) where users can submit URLs to check if they are safe or suspicious. The backend continuously learns from user feedback and adapts to new phishing patterns.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression chosen as best performer).
- Web interface built with Django.
- SQLite database for storing URLs, predictions, and user feedback.
- Crowdsourcing mechanism for reporting false positives/negatives.
- Real-time phishing link detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bibeksuhang/Phising-link-detetction-using-ML-and-Crowdsourcing.git
cd Phising-link-detetction-using-ML-and-Crowdsourcing
````

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Since there is no `requirements.txt`, install the core dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install django scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
```

If you encounter missing packages later, install them as prompted.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Superuser (Optional for Admin Access)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now, open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
